# intro-to-python-class
This intro to python class is based on the CS 301 course at Univeristy of Wisconsin.
By no means is the content of this class sponsored or endorsed by the Univerity of Wisconsin.

I have designed and programmed the content inside of this course by myself.
In every section, there is a quiz, homework assignment, playground and gradebook for students to use.
There are hidden files that are utilized for the background, simplified into a bash script auto_grade for the users to run and grade their work.

Since the solutions are hard coded, everything needs to be verbatim in order to be considered a correct answer.

This course is designed to teach the basics and fundamentals of the python programming language.
