# Homework One
class HW_One:

	# Instructions for Homework

	# Each Homework problem will be denoted by a function.
		# Example.   def problem_one(self):    means that you are on the first homework problem

	# Your task is to fill out each function so that it returns the correct result.
	# Read the documentation above each function to learn what the task is to do!


	# Prints the following message to the terminal
	# 'I am learning to code in Python!'

	# * Note * Additionally, the single quotes are used to denote the output is a string. 
	# 		You do not need to include these in your output message, just make sure the output is type, string

	# Example outputs:
	# problem_One()          'I am learning to code in Python!'
	def problem_one(self):
		# Type the contents of the print statement after the return statement.
		# Example.  If your code looks like this ->     print('Hello World!')
		# 			Then you should type this ->		return 'Hello World!'

		# TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

		return ''


	# Prompt the user to type in the desired number!
	# The desired number will be held in a variable called DESIRED_NUMBER

	# * Note * The square brackets [ ] are used to denote user input! These should not be included in your output.

	# Example outputs:
	# problem_Two()		'Type in the desired number: [user_input]'

	def problem_two(self):
		# The desired number
		DESIRED_NUMBER = 9

		# Delete the None value and enter the correct function.
		USER_INPUT = None 

		# Type the function as a string after the return statement
		# Example.  If your code looks like this ->     print('Hello World!')
		# 			Then you should type this ->		return 'print(\'Hello World!\')'

		# TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

		# Do not remove 
		return ""


	# Recreate and print the following symbol
	# '\/\/\/\/\/'

	# * Note * the single quotes are used to denote the output is a string. 
	# 		You do not need to include these in your output message, just make sure the output is type, string

	# Example outputs:
	# problem_three()			'\/\/\/\/\/'
	def problem_three(self):
		# Type the contents of the print statement after the return statement.
		# Example.  If your code looks like this ->     print('Hello World!')
		# 			Then you should type this ->		return 'Hello World!'
