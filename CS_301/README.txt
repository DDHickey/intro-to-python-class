CS 301: University of Wisconsin-Madison


Course Description:
	CS 301, Introduction to Data Programming, aims to teach these skills to students who may not otherwise want to major in computer sciences by offering a slower-paced and more applications-focused introduction to programming than our already-popular 302 course.

	Through a combination of classroom instruction and hands-on experience, students with no prior programming experience will learn about program design, implementation, and style.
